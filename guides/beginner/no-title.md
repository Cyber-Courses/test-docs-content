# No Title Test

This file has no `title` field in its frontmatter to test fallback behavior.

## What's Missing

The frontmatter above is missing the `title` field, which should cause the system to:
1. Use the H1 heading as the title
2. Fall back to the filename if no H1 exists
3. Use "Untitled" as a last resort

## Testing Navigation

This helps test:
- Title resolution in sidebar
- Title resolution in breadcrumbs
- Title resolution in navigation tree
- Fallback mechanisms

## Expected Behavior

The navigation should display "No Title Test" (from the H1) instead of failing.

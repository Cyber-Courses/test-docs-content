# First Steps

Welcome! This guide will walk you through your very first experience with our library.

## What We'll Build

We'll create a simple "Hello World" application that demonstrates the basic concepts.

## Step 1: Project Setup

First, let's create a new project:

```bash
mkdir my-first-app
cd my-first-app
npm init -y
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

Install our library:

```bash
npm install our-library
```

## Step 3: Create Your First File

Create a file called `app.js`:

```javascript
import { Library } from 'our-library';

const lib = new Library();
console.log('Hello from our library!');
```

## Step 4: Run Your Application

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see: `Hello from our library!`

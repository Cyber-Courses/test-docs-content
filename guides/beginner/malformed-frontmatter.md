# Malformed Frontmatter Test

This file has intentionally malformed frontmatter to test error handling.

## What's Wrong

The frontmatter above has several issues:
- Missing closing quote in description
- Missing closing bracket in tags array
- Invalid date (January 32nd doesn't exist)

## Expected Behavior

The system should:
1. Detect the malformed frontmatter
2. Log an error
3. Fall back to default values
4. Still render the content

## Testing Error Handling

This file helps test:
- Frontmatter parsing error handling
- Graceful degradation
- Error logging
- Content rendering with missing metadata
